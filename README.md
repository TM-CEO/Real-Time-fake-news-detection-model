# Real-Time fake news detection model
 This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fake news using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. With the growing spread of misinformation on the internet, especially across social media, the ability to automatically distinguish between real and fake news has become increasingly important.  Using a dataset of labeled news articles, the project demonstrates the full pipeline — from data preprocessing and feature extraction (TF-IDF) to model training and evaluation. A Logistic Regression classifier is used to achieve accurate results, and the notebook includes visualizations and evaluation metrics to interpret the model’s performance.  This project serves as a foundational step toward more advanced fake news detection systems, such as those leveraging deep learning or transformer-based architectures like BERT.
